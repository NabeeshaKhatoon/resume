# Responsive Web Page

This project is a responsive webpage design that adjusts its layout for both desktop and mobile devices. The page includes sections for text content, an image, and interactive buttons. The design focuses on ease of use, a clean interface, and a professional look.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The webpage is fully responsive and adjusts layout based on screen size, ensuring optimal display on both mobile devices and desktops.
- **Interactive Elements**: Includes hover effects on buttons, changing the background color and scaling them slightly when hovered.
- **Image Styling**: The image is styled to have rounded corners and adjusts size responsively.
- **Typography**: Headers and paragraphs are well-structured with a clean and modern font style.

## CSS Highlights

- **Linear Gradients**: Applied to background elements for a subtle yet appealing effect.
- **Box Shadow**: Used to give a sense of depth to elements like the `.box` and `.box2` classes.
